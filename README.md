# Sciwrix

Sciwrix is a portable, self-contained Markdown editor designed for scientific and technical writing. It combines Markdown editing, rendered preview, WYSIWYG-style editing, LaTeX mathematics, image embedding, document styles, undo/redo, and print/PDF support in a single HTML  file.

## Current application

The complete web application is stored in [`index.html`](./index.html). Download that one file and open it in a modern browser; no installation or web server is required.

- [Launch Sciwrix online](https://coolkama.github.io/Sciwrix/)
- [Latest release downloads](https://github.com/Coolkama/Sciwrix/releases/latest)

The product homepage explains the online, standalone HTML, Windows and Android versions and provides current download links.

## Running Sciwrix in a browser

1. Download `index.html` or use the **Download Sciwrix.html** button on the product homepage.
2. Optionally rename it to `Sciwrix.html`.
3. Open it in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, or another modern browser.

All required application code and libraries are embedded in the HTML file.

## Android app

The Android project is stored in [`android`](./android). It packages the same self-contained `index.html` application in a native WebView wrapper with Android `.md` file association, native file selection, direct saving for writable documents and printing support.

Every push affecting the application or Android wrapper runs smoke checks, Android lint and a debug APK build. Proper signed releases are produced manually through the **Release Android APK** GitHub Actions workflow after the repository signing secrets have been configured.

See [`android/RELEASING.md`](./android/RELEASING.md) for the one-time signing setup and release procedure.

## Windows app

The project in [`windows`](./windows) packages the same offline editor as one portable `Sciwrix.exe`. It adds native Windows file dialogs, direct Markdown saving, printing, command-line opening and drag-and-drop. It is self-contained, so users do not need to install .NET; the standard Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime is the only system prerequisite.

Download `Sciwrix.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Coolkama/Sciwrix/releases/latest). No installation is required. To make Sciwrix available for Markdown files, choose **Windows → Associate with Markdown files…** and confirm the association in Windows Default Apps.

## Development

Sciwrix deliberately keeps the distributed application self-contained. Changes should be tested on both desktop and mobile-sized browser windows, including Markdown editing, visual editing, undo/redo, mathematics rendering, file loading, saving, printing and preview synchronisation.

Run the repository smoke checks with:

```bash
python3 tools/smoke_test.py
```

## Status

Sciwrix is under active development. The repository contains the latest web, standalone HTML, Android and portable Windows editions.
